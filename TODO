finish writing FAQ in README
error if you change state from in_use to available for an IP that exists in record.content
set defaults in config file for several settings (like defaults for soa record)
headers to disable automatically creating/modifying domains, soa, ptr records
don't allow deleting of domain until all records are deleted first
complete all valiations for record
404 and 500 errors should respect Accept header
write audit job that validates records match domain, valid soa, orphan records, ptr errors, etc
soa serial number should increment date format on change
only update soa once per transaction (or every N minutes?)
only allow delete subnet if all IPs are available
auto create PTR records for AAAA records
auto create SOA record for in-addr-arpa when we add a subnet?
automatically set network, gateway and broadcast as in use
write lots more tests (especially around error handling)
document web services API
complete/make usable web UI
update README to explain how there can be multiple A records with same content, but only one ptr per ip
update README to explain relationship between A records content and IP resources
validate CNAME content resolves
respond with deleted object on delete
command line confirmation for write operations (with --quiet or something to disable)
splitting up base and mask_bits in subnets was a mistake (complete transition to "name")
cli should convert "--domain foo" to "--domain_id 1" for you
